I've used lighthouse as launcher thus far, but it's no longer maintained and doesn't always quite do what I want it to. Also, I wanted to learn XCB and few other APIs so this seemed like a good idea. And by 'this' I mean rewriting the whole damn thing from scratch with modifications I wanted to include. Because forking would have been way too easy ":D".
